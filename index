          <p>I just finished my second year of studying computer science in the <span class="caps">EECS</span> department of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.  I do research on computer networks with Mark Allman and am working in New York City this summer with Bloomberg LP in a software development internship. In the past I have worked with Marc Canter at Broadband Mechanics on the People Aggregator social networking platform.  I am language and framework agnostic and always enjoy exploring new topics.  Sometimes I have things to say, if you want, you can read them <a href="http://blog.brianstack.net" id="blog">here</a>, or look below for some more things I do.</p>

            <b>How to use your shell -</b>
            September 7, 2011
            <div class='tr'>
              A short talk on how to use the Unix shell (specifically bash) given as part of the <span class="caps">CWRU</span> Hacker Society&#8217;s start of the year talk &#8220;Everything You Won&#8217;t Learn About Linux In Class&#8221;.

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>I do work trying to find patterns in internet scanning activity.  I work with Tom Dooner, another Case undergrad, to analyze more than a decades worth of <span class="caps">BRO</span> logs from <span class="caps">LBNL</span>.  We work under Mark Allman, a researcher associated with Case and <span class="caps">ICSI</span> in Berkeley, California.  He published a paper on this topic which you can find <a href="http://www.icir.org/mallman/papers/" class="icsi">here</a> , and we are taking a deeper look into their initial findings.</p>
          <h3>Work</h3>
          <h4>Bloomberg Law</h4>
          <p>For the next couple of months, during the summer of 2011, I will be living and working in New York City.  I am an intern at Bloomberg LP, a company mostly known for their financial data and news services, but I am working on a relatively new offering of theirs in the field of law.</p>
          <h4>Civic Commons</h4>
          <p>For a couple of months at the beginning of the 2010-2011 school year, I helped integrate People Aggregator into a project to enable citizens of the North East Ohio area get more involved in their political process. The project can be found <a href="http://www.theciviccommons.com/" class="cc">here</a>.  The project used People Aggregator as an engine to store users, and I helped integrate it into a Ruby on Rails application that was developed for the project.</p>

          </a>
          <h4>Broadband Mechanics</h4>
          <p>I worked over last summer as a software developer at <a href="http://www.broadbandmechanics.com/">Broadband Mechanics</a>, a company owned by Marc Canter.  Most of my effort went into the People Aggregator social networking platform, which is the primary product of that company.  In addition I aided in his efforts to volunteer to educate youth in <span class="caps">STEM</span> programs, and to build a &#8220;digital city&#8221; which you can read more about on his <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/">blog</a>.</p>
          <h3>Projects</h3>
          <h4>Algorithms final project</h4>
          <p>An implementation of the Edmonds-Karp algorithm of the Ford-Fulkerson method.  This is a method of solving the class of max-flow problems.  The idea is to maximally use the capacities of edges between nodes in a &#8220;flow network&#8221; which is a directed graph, and in our case, with only a single source and single sink.  Interestingly more efficient solutions to this fundamental problem are still being found, with an improvement made as recently as <a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/max-flow-speedup-0927.html">2010</a>.</p>
